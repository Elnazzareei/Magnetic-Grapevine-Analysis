# Abstract
This study investigates the effects of magnetic field treatments on biochemical compounds in two grapevine cultivars (Vitis vinifera L.). We examined how different magnetization methods and intensities affect carbohydrate, protein, phenolic, anthocyanin, and enzyme (PPO, POD) levels.
# Experimental Design
Plant Material
- Cultivars: Rasha (Vitis vinifera cv. Rasha) and Sultanin (Vitis vinifera cv. Sultanin)
- Growth Stage: 60-day-old potted vines
- Growth Conditions: Greenhouse
# Treatments
Code, Treatment Description, Magnetic Field Intensity, Application Method 
T1, Control, 0 T, Normal Hogland nutrient solution
T2, Mag. S 0.1, 0.1 T, Hogland solution magnetized before application 
T3, Mag. S 0.2, 0.2 T, Hogland solution magnetized before application
T4, Mag. W+S 0.1, 0.1 T, Water magnetized before mixing with Hogland
T5, Mag. W+S 0.2, 0.2 T, Water magnetized before mixing with Hogland
# Experimental Setup
- Design: Completely Randomized Design (CRD)
- Replications: 3 pots per treatment × cultivar combination
- Total Units: 2 cultivars × 5 treatments × 3 replications = 30 experimental units
# Measured Parameters
- Primary Metabolites: 
  - Carbohydrate content (mg/g dry weight)
  - Total protein (mg/g dry weight)
- Secondary Metabolites:
  - Total phenol (mg GAE/g dry weight)
  - Anthocyanin (mg/g dry weight)
- Enzyme Activities:
  - Polyphenol oxidase (PPO, units/g protein)
  - Peroxidase (POD, units/g protein)
# Statistical Analysis
- Two-way ANOVA with interaction (Cultivar × Treatment)
- Post-hoc Tukey HSD test (α = 0.05)
- Effect size calculation (Partial η²)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA)
